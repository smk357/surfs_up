### An analysis of weather data in Oahu, Hawaii

## Overview

The purpose of the project was to use SQLalchemy queries on a SQLlite database to derive temperature data fom Oahu, Hawaii, for the months of June and August. The dataset spanned several years and summary statistics were aggregrated for June and August separately.

## Results

- Summary statistics for June:

- Mean temperature for June (~75 F) was higher than December (~71 F)
- June and December had comparable maximum temperatures (85 F and 83 F respectively)
- December had a singificantly lower minimum temperature than June (56 F vs 64 F), indicating greater temperature fluctuations in December

## Summary

- Both June and December show promising temperatures for recreational activities (surfing, ice cream)
- December's minimum temparature (56 F) indicates that it can be cold enough to discourage outdoor activities, however the similar mean and maximum temperature to June indicates that there is enough fluctuation in the temperature to encourage it on certain days
